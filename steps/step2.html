                    <p class="info">Before we start making our PCB, we've gotta choose a sensor to put on your board.
                        For my Hermes board, I used a gyroscope so I could mount it on my bike and see how smooth my
                        biking is. You can choose from hundreds of different types of sensors to fit what you wanna do
                        with your Hermes!

                        sensor, or even
                        a Geiger counter (which tracks radiation)! The possibilities are endless.

                        When you're browsing for sensors, you'll see a lot of filters. We don't care about most of
                        these (mostly because they're inaccurate). We need only I2C sensors, but if you select that
                        filter and
                        there's only like 2 available sensors that show up, something's probably wrong. You can totally
                        use them, especially
                        if they're in stock and cheap, but most of the time they're not, so we'll have to do some manual
                        digging.

                        I2C is a method of communication between electrical components. In this case, we're going
                        to be communicating between a sensor and a microcontroller. You could communicate between a
                        sensor and a sensor, a microcontroller and a microcontroller, or even both at the same time.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div style="background-color: #638a47; border-radius: 1rem; padding-right: 0.5rem; padding-left: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;">

                    <p style="color: white; padding-left: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.2rem; text-align: left; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
                        There's 2 main communication protocols we care about: SPI and I2C (pronounced eye-squared-see).
                        SPI is older, more finicky, and uses more pins, so we're using I2C. SPI generally has 4 pins,
                        MISO (Master In, Slave Out), MOSI (Master Out, Slave In), SCK (serial clock), and CS (chip
                        select). These
                        are data pins and you don't have to worry about them right now, but you should totally google
                        around and find
                        out some more.
                    </p>

                        I2C's pins are SDA and SCL. SDA is serial data (handles data transfer between components),
                        and SCL is serial clock (handles timing of information). SCL is important cause information
                        doesn't make any sense if you receive it out of order.

                        In the checkbox section below the filters, check the box for "Economic" PCBA type. Some
                        soldering
                        methods are harder to automate than others, so JLCPCB splits these parts into Economic and
                        Standard.
                        Economic can be like $5 and Standard can be like $200. So make sure that you're only using
                        Economic
                        components.

                        Now we have to make sure that the sensor supports I2C. Click your first result and open up its
                        datasheet. A datasheet is a sheet about a components
                        data (pretty self-explanatory.) If your results are super expensive (>$5), you can sort by price
                        ascending.

                        In the component's datasheet, scroll down to the table of contents and ctrl-f search for "pin".
                        Find the pinout or pin description, which is a table that tells you what each pin
                        does and where to connect it to, which is SUPER COOL and SUPER CONVENIENT.

                        Make sure your pinout table has SDA and SCL pins. If it doesn't, then it doesn't support I2C.
                        Some sensors have both SPI and I2C pins, and that's fine (we'll only be using the I2C ones).

                        You can also just ctrl-f I2C and see what pops up, but you'll need the pinout table anyway
                        for your schematic.

                        Once you've found a sensor you like, has Economic PCBA, and supports I2C, you're set! I'm choosing
                        the MPU-6500 because I've worked with MPUs before and it's expensive enough that it'll be good quality.
