                        Most parts on JLCPCB have symbols and footprints linked on their info page, but they're
                        made by EasyEDA and you need to pay for an account (boo). If you google your part name +
                        kicad symbol you'll probably see a SnapMagic link (you'll have to make a SnapMagic account).

                        Open up KiCAD's schematic editor and place your sensor's symbol. Most likely, your sensor
                        is a square with a bunch of pins sticking out each side. Your symbol won't look like this,
                        but make sure the pins on the symbol match the ones on the pinout table.

                        that downloaded and imported). Place that into your schematic as well. Later, you'll have to
                        copy over the XIAO's footprint into your Hermes footprint folder, but after that you're golden.

                        also
                        communicating using I2C), so if you wanted to use a screen, 7 segment display, or something else

                        I2C is great because there's only 2 pins, AND because the wiring is insanely simple.
                        All SDA pins connect and all SCL pins connect. No matter how many components you have,
                        all SDA pins connect and all SCL pins connect.

                        pins.

                    You HAVE to connect a 4.7k resistor to the SDA and SCL pins on your XIAO. These are
                    pull-up resistors. I2C is open drain, which means it can only pull voltage low. To make sure
                    data isn't "floating" (neither high nor low, 1 or 0), you have to connect pull-UP resistors that
                    will
                    bring the voltage high. It takes a bit to understand, so I'd recommend googling it for a bit.

                        For the rest of your schematic, your sensor's datasheet will be your best friend. It'll
                        tell you what each pin does, where you have to connect it, and if you need capacitors,
                        resistors, or any other add-ons that you may not have known otherwise.

                        For example, I had no idea the MPU-6500 needed 3 capacitors. After reading through the pinout
                        table and seeing a bunch of weird pins (FSYNC and VDDIO), I scrolled down and it showed me a
                        sample
                        circuit for the sensor, where I saw what each pin should be connected to and where I had to use
                        capacitors. While your datasheet may not have a sample circuit, it's common to catch little
                        details
                        like that while you're wiring your schematic.

                        All the pins that the datasheet isn't specific enough for you can google for, like interrupt
                        pins. Interrupt pins are a common feature on sensors; they send a signal to the MCU when the
                        sensor
                        detects a change. This stops the microcontroller from having to check the data input pins of the
                        sensor
                        every like 2 milliseconds.

                        the capacitor placement, attached the interrupt pin to a GPIO pin on the XIAO (like you should
                        too),
                        followed the reserved pins' instructions, and googled whatever else I needed (like what to
