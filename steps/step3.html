                        Most parts on JLCPCB have symbols and footprints linked on their info page, but they're
                        made by EasyEDA and you need to pay for an account (boo). If you google your part name +
                        kicad symbol you'll probably see a SnapMagic link (you'll have to make a SnapMagic account).

                        It doesn't matter where you get your symbol and footprint from, or even if you get them from 2
                        separate
                        places, they'll be pretty accurate. If you're having trouble finding them, shoot a message in
                        the #electronics and #hermes channels.

                        Open up KiCAD's schematic editor and place your sensor's symbol. Most likely, your sensor
                        is a square with a bunch of pins sticking out each side. Your symbol won't look like this,
                        but make sure the pins on the symbol match the ones on the pinout table.

                        We're going to be using the XIAO RP2040 microcontroller, just like pathfinder (so you should
                        already have
                        that downloaded and imported). Place that into your schematic as well. Later, you'll have to
                        copy over the XIAO's footprint into your Hermes footprint folder, but after that you're golden.

                        There's 2 main communication protocols we care about: SPI and I2C (pronounced eye-squared-see).
                        SPI is older, more finicky, and uses more pins, so we're using I2C. SPI generally has 4 pins,
                        MISO (Master In, Slave Out), MOSI (Master Out, Slave In), SCK (serial clock), and CS (chip
                        select). These
                        are data pins and you don't have to worry about them right now, but you should totally google
                        around and find
                        out some more.
                    </p>

                        I2C's pins are SDA and SCL. SDA is serial data (handles data transfer between components),
                        and SCL is serial clock (handles timing of information). SCL is important cause information
                        doesn't make any sense if you receive it out of order.

                        In the checkbox section below the filters, check the box for "Economic" PCBA type. Some
                        soldering
                        methods are harder to automate than others, so JLCPCB splits these parts into Economic and
                        Standard.
                        Economic can be like $5 and Standard can be like $200. So make sure that you're only using
                        Economic
                        components.

                        Now we have to make sure that the sensor supports I2C. Click your first result and open up its
                        datasheet. A datasheet is a sheet about a components
                        data (pretty self-explanatory.) If your results are super expensive (>$5), you can sort by price
                        ascending.

                        Find the pinout or pin description, which is a table that tells you what each pin
                        does and where to connect it to, which is SUPER COOL and SUPER CONVENIENT.

                        Some sensors have both SPI and I2C pins, and that's fine (we'll only be using the I2C ones).
